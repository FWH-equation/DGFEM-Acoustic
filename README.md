# MATH0471-DG
This project consists in studying a hyperbolic system of equations in its conservation form. Spatial discretization will be performed using the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method and Lagrange nodal basis functions on unstructured meshes. An explicit time-marching method will be chosen.

## 1D simulation

First simulation with average flux and time step of 0.0001. Elements order 3.
